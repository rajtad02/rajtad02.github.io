            <h2>Who are Oromia's Neighbors?</h2>
            <p>This blog correlates to the <a href = https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLobsM7MOWfWHDttmbN-g_cQ14bXfTGybK>The Neighborhood Series</a> that I created during the summer of 2021 (or maybe 2020). I created it while I was still in high school when I was an intern for Kello Media, an Oromo news organization. It was originally uploaded on their social media, but because of fears they had about getting their channel removed, due to mass reporting efforts from Ethiopian homogenist groups, they took down some of their content. That is why the date of upload on the YouTube channel doesn't align with when it was created, because I had to reupload it. Now, a good question to ask is, “Why would this content be deemed controversial in the first place?”</p>
            <p>The Neighborhood Series is a series about communities that are in Oromia’s “neighborhood. Oromia is a nation in the Horn of Africa created during the years of the Derg’s reign in Ethiopia (1974-1991). People often quote the fact that Ethiopia was never colonized by European powers and how it was one of the earliest Christian nations in the world. While these are true, people lack the fact that modern-day Ethiopia is nothing like Abyssinia, the nation everyone else is referring to, even though they are heavily related. Abyssinia was an empire that resided in the northern highlands of modern-day Ethiopia. This Abyssinia included kingdoms like Gonder, Gojam, Shewa, and Tigray. A majority of the inhabitants were Habesha, a term used to refer to the Semitic people like Amhara and Tigray, but there were many indigenous Cushitic/Nilotic groups as well. And Abyssinia was indeed a Christian empire on top of that, but what is left out is how they used their religion politically to establish a connection with Europe before other groups in Africa, which they used to conquer the rest of modern-day Ethiopia, including the Oromo people, and stay independent.</p>
            <p>The expansion of Abyssinia started around the 1800s and went on to incorporate a large number of diverse people. Ethiopia used to be a Christian nation; however, now it is a religiously diverse nation, with at least a third of its citizens being muslim. Ethiopia used to be, for the most part, a Habesha nation; now its biggest ethnic group is the Oromos, a Cushitic nation that has very different roots compared to the Habesha. In fact, the majority of Ethiopia is Cushitic after Abyssinia expanded East and South.</p>
            <p>This series, however, was not created to bash Ethiopia's past, but to talk about different nations in the Horn of Africa who don’t get the representation on the world stage that they deserve. Talks in Ethiopia are typically dominated by the Amhara and Tigray (due to them being the forebears of Ethiopia) and Oromos (due to their population size). The smaller nations don’t get much representation. The first “season” of this series was supposed to focus on nations that are grouped into Ethiopia’s former Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR): a region I believe that grouped up diverse groups of people together with little regards to their differences, creating a prolonging issues related to representation that aren’t effectively addressed, because they are forced to share one mouth piece as the SNNPR. In this season, I planned to make a total of 6 parts (two episodes per nation) to talk about the Sidama, the Gurage/Silte, and the Wolaita as they represent the three stocks of people typically seen in that region: Cushitic, Semitic, and Omotic people, respectively. Sadly, I didn’t have enough time, as this was my first foray into editing and doing heavy research on groups of people I’ve never read up about.</p>
            <p>So the whole reason I called it the neighborhood is because I’m recognizing these smaller groups as more than ethnicities: they are nations, at least to me. These groups, including the Oromos, had a history before they were conquered and incorporated into Ethiopia. They have had a political struggle, each unique to their own nation, with Ethiopia. They just don’t have the numbers to represent themselves on the bigger stage. Because they are drowned out and undereducated about who they are, I believe that is often why they are used by other nations exploitatively. For example, “Why do Oromos always complain? Everyone else lives in harmony: just look at the SNNPR.” This viewpoint is just not accurate and doesn’t represent what is happening on the ground. I will acknowledge, however, a lot has changed since I created that documentary series, but I won’t get into that, or else this blog would be even longer.</p>
            <p>Other than that, the experience I had making this documentary was amazing. I learned about so many groups of people and how they interacted with each other, and how they struggled with the Ethiopian empire. One thing I could surely say is that the idea that Ethiopia’s expansion was peaceful is just not true. Some nations may have had a more peaceful incorporation into the empire, but most groups resisted. That doesn’t mean that there can’t be peace today in Ethiopia, but there just needs to be a genuine effort and conversation on not just how Ethiopia should move forward, but the whole Horn of African region.</p>
            <p>Another aspect I enjoyed about making this series was the graphics I created. All the graphics were created in Canva, and the editing was done in Shotcut. I have never done video editing before this, but it felt really natural, and creating graphics on Canva was something I had some experience in, but I never took it to this level. I’m very artistic as it already is. I play four instruments: the piano, saxophone, masenqo, and krar, with the last two being traditional instruments found in Eritrea and Ethiopia. I’m also very involved with traditional Oromo dance, as I’ve been dancing for the Oromo Student Union at the University of Minnesota from my sophomore year in high school to my sophomore year at Carleton College. I’ve also danced for other organizations and created my own cultural troupe alongside partners called the Hawwisoo Minnesota. So being able to express myself digitally was something new, but very fun. Even finding and overlaying different background sounds to match the tone of the scene, but that was still related to the nation I was covering, was another area I had fun in. At this point in my life, I was set on being a journalist, and this was the most fun I had in a while at the time.</p>
            <p>To close out this blog, I will answer the question I brought up initially: Why would this content be deemed controversial in the first place? I hope by reading this far, you would already have an idea, but there is a short answer: because it is. If we make a distinction between Abyssinia and modern-day Ethiopia, starting from when Ethiopia expanded South in the 1800s, then we would know that Ethiopia is a relatively young country compared to other established countries around the world (you could say it’s also relatively old if you compare it to its African neighbors). Most of its history is filled with violence and forced assimilation of those not of Abyssinian stock. My parents grew up not being allowed to speak their language in school. My dad and grandparents were part of mass conversations in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, with very little knowledge of the religion. Oromos, a people rumored to be between the size of 40-60 million, still face challenges when fighting for representation in the country, so it should be expected that people would have a problem with other people being recognized as nations. Nations sound like independent states, but it doesn’t have to be that way. These people had separate histories from one another and different political practices. I wanted to give them agency and learn more about them. Whether or not they wanted to be an independent state was not my concern with that series; I just wanted to give them agency and representation.</p>
