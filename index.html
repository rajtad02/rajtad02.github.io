            <p id="glitch-text">Welcome to my website! I’m <b>RAJEERA GELETA</b>, and I’m a recent Carleton College graduate of class 2025. During my time at Carleton, I majored in computer science and minored in data science and statistics. While I enjoyed both fields, I found myself drawn more to the computer science field because of courses like networking and my capstone seminar, hacking tools. In fact, it was my capstone project, creating an ARP Cache Poisoning/Spoofing tool, that led me to pursue a job in cybersecurity. If you want to know more about my experience learning about ARP and creating the spoofing tool, click here!</p>
            <p>Other than cybersecurity, I’m also very passionate about my nation, Oromia, a homeland to the Oromos and many others in the Horn of Africa! I formed and lead a cultural troupe in Minnesota called Hawwisoo Minnesota, where we perform cultural song and dance across the state to educate more people about the Oromos and their history. I also founded and was the president of the Horn of Africa Student Association @Carleton. Other than showcasing my culture/history to the world, I also plan to work on projects that preserve our history for the world to see. So if you want to see more of that, click here!</p>
            <p>Otherwise, feel free to continue exploring my site. Below this, you’ll find all my relevant work experience: computer science stuff on the left and Oromo stuff on the right. If you want to learn more about it, feel free to click on the text, and it should navigate you to a page about my experience working there. Otherwise, feel free to see my projects and blogs, or to contact me using the toolbar at the top of the site. I hope you enjoy your time here and don’t leave too soon!</p>
